# Automatic-intensity-based-tagger-of-facial-gestures
This repository contains a full workflow for automatic, intensity-based annotation of facial gestures. This allows for larger datasets than before and for reliable, between-subjects annotation with computer-vision and calibration. This full work-flow requires Live Link and provides post-processing for integration with ELAN.
